    <h2> Background </h2>
        <p>I've had the privilege to work at venture-backed startups to Fortune 500 companies, working on all things growth, strategy, content, and design. </p> 
        <p>In my short career, I've found myself working in sectors such as Hollywood, games, social apps, streaming, VR/AR, electric cars, sports, and luxury goods. </p>
        <p> Driven by an incessant desire for increasing <b>human connection</b>, <b>personal expression</b>, and <b>narratives</b>, I strive to work in new mediums and formats that disrupt, impact, and innovate these three core pillars.</p>
        <p>I graduated from Columbia University with a double major in Computer Science and Film & Media Studies in 2023.</p>
        <p>Born in Seoul. I've lived in Nashville, Fort Lauderdale, and call St. Louis my home town. I am currently based in New York City.</p>
        <p>Outside work, I am passionate about supporting newly-arrived immigrant integration and youth mental health advocacy.</p>
